# Patched third-party crates

Each directory here is a crate exactly as published on crates.io (the `.crate` contents: sources, `Cargo.toml`,
`Cargo.toml.orig`, `Cargo.lock`, `.cargo_vcs_info.json`) plus the patches listed below, and nothing else. The
workspace uses them through `[patch.crates-io]` in `Engine/Cargo.toml`; they are not workspace members (`exclude`), so
our formatting, lints and tests do not run on them. Every patched place carries a comment that starts with
`Project Avalanche patch` and names its patch (T1…T20 below).

**Licenses.** lightyear and bevy_replicon are MIT OR Apache-2.0. lightyear's published crates carry no license file;
each lightyear directory holds `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` from the lightyear repository at the commit the
0.31.0 crates were published from (`8a926d6fece6a0cf04c2747de90c01258524fe0d`, per each crate's
`.cargo_vcs_info.json`). bevy_replicon 0.45.2's crate carries its own two license files (published from
`7af0114ca0763e076dc95302c5a095e6eff384e3`). Apache-2.0 §4(b) asks modified files to say so: the patch comments and
this file do. rav1d 1.1.0 is BSD-2-Clause; its crate carries `COPYING` (VideoLAN, the dav1d authors, the Internet
Security Research Group; published from `782dab2135ea64a057c097088a13eb8ed3cc3320`).
gilrs 0.11.2 is MIT OR Apache-2.0; its published crate omits the root license files, so its directory also carries
`LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE` from its published commit `07e286e24b046cf39e5c367daa2770b805a64692` in
`https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs` (the commit recorded in `.cargo_vcs_info.json`). Its bundled
`SDL_GameControllerDB/LICENSE` is retained unchanged (zlib, Sam Lantinga).

**Decisions.** The user, 2026-10-23 (`Docs/architecture/multiplayer.md` §16, D18 and D19): patch lightyear in the
workspace, keep `std` maths, fix the crash bugs in our copy, report nothing upstream. Measurements:
`Docs/architecture/network.md` §7, §9; T9…T12 came with multiplayer phase 1 (round `net1`), T10…T12 from its audit of
lightyear's and replicon's panics and errors on peer input (`network.md` §12), each crash confirmed by a hostile case
against the upstream code first. rav1d: the user's decision of 2026-11-07 (taken as recommended, decision M-D9 in
`Docs/architecture/modding.md` §16), measured in `Docs/architecture/content.md` §20.9: the assembly on, 8-bit only.

**The export.** `Engine/tools/export/export.py` copies this folder verbatim into the game's repository, with the
`[patch.crates-io]` entries the exported packages need (comments are not stripped from third-party code; the license
files and this file are kept; `Docs/architecture/export.md`).

**Upgrading.** A lightyear upgrade replaces these directories with the new release's crates and applies each patch
again (or drops it if the release has an equivalent fix); the line numbers below are 0.31.0's.

## T1 — fragment reassembly is bounded (`lightyear_transport`)

**Why.** `FragmentReceiver::receive_fragment` (`src/channel/fragments/receive.rs:56`) created a `FragmentConstructor`
(`:83`, `new` at `:137`) for the first fragment of every message id, and `new` allocated `vec![false; num_fragments]`
(`:145`) and `vec![0; num_fragments × fragment_size]` (`:146`) with `num_fragments` straight from the packet (a u64
varint), before any check. One 30-byte packet from any connected peer declaring 2^40 fragments aborted the process
("memory allocation of 1099511627776 bytes failed"). Moderate counts on many message ids reserved memory without
limit, and reliable channels never expired an incomplete message (`expires_fragments`, `src/channel/receive.rs:179`;
the cleanup at `:143`).

**What.**
- `FragmentLimits` (new, `src/channel/fragments/receive.rs`; exported in the prelude): `max_message_size` (the
  largest declared message, fragment count × fragment size), `max_in_flight_bytes` (incomplete messages per channel
  and connection), `reliable_stale_after`. A Bevy resource that `TransportPlugin` initialises with a default (1 MiB,
  4 MiB, 10 s; a guess marker at the code states it) and an application replaces; `ssx-net` sets its protocol's limits
  (16 KiB, 64 KiB, 10 s; `crates/ssx-net/src/limits.rs`).
- `receive_fragment` checks the declared size against `max_message_size` and the channel's reserved bytes plus it
  against `max_in_flight_bytes` before creating a constructor; the new errors `FragmentedMessageTooLarge` and
  `FragmentBudgetExceeded` (`ChannelReceiveError`, `src/channel/receive.rs:16`). The receiver counts the bytes each
  constructor reserves and releases them when the message completes or expires (`cleanup`).
- Reliable channels expire an incomplete message after `reliable_stale_after` without a new fragment (unreliable ones
  keep upstream's 3 s, `DISCARD_AFTER`): `ChannelReceive::update` (`src/channel/receive.rs:143`) takes the limits;
  every received fragment records its time (`:162` passed `None` for reliable channels).
- `ChannelReceive::fragment_bytes_in_flight` (new, public): what a channel holds, for tests and diagnostics.
- `TransportPlugin::buffer_receive` (`src/plugin.rs:79`) reads the resource and passes it on; `buffer_recv` and
  `update` take it. Upstream's unit tests pass the default limits (`src/channel/fragments/receive.rs`,
  `src/channel/receive.rs`, `src/channel/builder.rs` test helpers) and initialise the resource where they run the
  receive system on a bare `World` (`src/plugin.rs` tests); two new tests: a declared size above the limit is refused
  with nothing reserved; partial messages are refused above the budget and freed by the cleanup.

## T2 — a protocol mismatch disconnects instead of panicking (`lightyear`)

**Why.** `ProtocolCheckPlugin::receive_verify_protocol` (`src/protocol.rs:58`) returned the mismatch as an error from an
observer (`:67`, `:70`, `:73`); Bevy's default error handler gives such errors the panic severity, so a server whose
message, component or channel registration differs from the client's (or one that forges the check) crashed every
client that connected.

**What.** The observer returns nothing; on a mismatch it logs an error, triggers the new `ProtocolMismatch { entity,
error }` (an `EntityEvent`, exported in the prelude with `ProtocolCheckError`, which gains `Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq`)
for the client link whose remote peer sent the check, and triggers lightyear's `Disconnect` on that link (netcode's
client disconnect: its packets tell the server). Bevy's global error handler is untouched.

## T3 — the server disconnects one client through netcode (`lightyear_netcode`)

**Why.** `NetcodeServer`'s server is crate-private; only `Stop` (`src/server_plugin.rs:428`) disconnected clients, all
of them. A server could only drop a client's link: netcode kept the session until its timeout and sent nothing, so the
client went on sending until it timed out.

**What.**
- A new observer `NetcodeServerPlugin::disconnect_client`: lightyear's `Disconnect` on a connected client link of a
  netcode server drops the payloads already queued on the link, calls the netcode server's `disconnect` for that
  client (its disconnect packets are queued, the session is forgotten) and inserts `Disconnecting` (the link is
  despawned in `Last`), as `Stop` does per client. Triggered before `PostUpdate`'s send, the disconnect packets leave in
  that frame (measured: the kicked client leaves `Connected` within 2 s, against its 3 s timeout before).
- The receive system's despawn of a disconnected client (`:401`) becomes `try_despawn`: the link may already be gone.
- `lightyear_transport`'s `TransportPlugin::buffer_send` (`src/plugin.rs:400`) skips links that are `Disconnecting`:
  netcode's send passes a disconnecting link's queue on as it is (`src/server_plugin.rs:256` of netcode keeps it for the
  disconnect packets), so packets the transport still built for the link would have gone out unencrypted (from the
  source; upstream's `Stop` has the same path).

## T4 — the UDP endpoint forgets a link's address (`lightyear_udp`)

**Why.** `UdpEndpoint::connected_addresses` (`src/endpoint.rs:53`) gained an entry for every new source address and lost
it only when the same address sent again after its link was gone (`:217`): one entry per address ever seen, spoofed
sources included, for the endpoint's lifetime.

**What.** A new observer `UdpEndpointPlugin::forget_link` on the removal of `UdpLinkOfIO` (a link despawned, or no
longer this transport's) removes the address's entry when it still names that link. `UdpEndpoint::address_count`
(new) reports the entries.

## T5 — no forced `libm` maths (`lightyear_replication`)

**Why.** The crate depended on `bevy_transform` with the feature `libm` (`Cargo.toml:120`, `Cargo.toml.orig:59`), which
turns on `bevy_math/libm` and `glam/libm`. Cargo unifies features over every package of one build, so any build that
contained lightyear compiled glam's and `bevy_math`'s float functions from the `libm` crate instead of `std`: the
game's physics moved (6 of 9 ride fingerprints, `bot_race`; traced to `glam/libm` alone).

**What.** `bevy_transform` without the feature; the crate's `std` feature turns on `bevy_transform/std` (a math backend
for builds without the game's Bevy); a new feature `libm` forwards to `bevy_transform/libm` for builds that want it.
`cargo tree -e features -i glam` / `-i bevy_math` for the workspace, `ssx-net` alone, the game alone and the physics
with `ssx-net`: no `libm`, `std` on (`nostd-libm`, which `bevy_internal` turns on as before, is inert with `std`).

## T6 — receive errors reach the application (`lightyear_transport`, `lightyear_messages`)

**Why.** A packet the transport could not parse (`src/plugin.rs:284` of the transport) or a message the message layer
could not read (an unknown message id, bytes that do not deserialize; `src/receive.rs:691` of the messages crate) was
logged at error level and dropped: the application could not tell which link sent it, so a client sending them could
be neither counted nor disconnected, and the log grew with every packet.

**What.** Two new Bevy messages, written where the errors were only logged: `TransportReceiveError { entity, error }`
(`lightyear_transport`, `src/plugin.rs`; registered by `TransportPlugin`) and `MessageReceiveError { entity, error }`
(`lightyear_messages`, `src/plugin.rs`, written in `src/receive.rs`; registered by `MessagePlugin`); both exported in
the preludes. The log line stays. These packets arrive after the connection layer authenticated them, so the link's
own peer sent them: `ssx-net` disconnects it at the first.

## T7 — replicon's foreign channels are refused, not passed on (`lightyear_replication`)

**Why.** lightyear registers replicon's three channels both ways and hands every message it receives on them to
replicon by the channel's index in its own list: the server's `receive_server_packets` (`src/server.rs:187`) passed a
client's message on the update or mutation channel to `ServerMessages::insert_received` with index 1 or 2, the
client's `receive_client_packets` (`src/client.rs:148`) a server's message on the mutation-ack channel with index 2.
Replicon has one client channel (the acks) and two server channels by default, and `insert_received` panics for a
channel it has not registered: one message from any connected client crashed the server ("server should have a
receive channel with id 1"), one from any server crashed the client ("client should have a channel with id 2"; both
measured, `Game-Data/Converted/handoff/net0/hostile/run4_patched.txt`, `d19/replication_from_server_unpatched.txt`).

**What.** Both functions pass on only the channels replicon receives on that side (`RepliconChannels::client_channels`
on the server, `server_channels` on the client); a message on another one is dropped, logged, and reported as a
`TransportReceiveError` (T6) with `TransportError::ChannelIdNotFound` for its link. (`ssx-net` drained these channels
itself before T7 existed; it now relies on the report.)

## T8 — netcode's per-client state stays bounded (`lightyear_netcode`)

**Why.** A valid connect request makes the netcode server create a pending connection (`ConnectionCache::add`,
`src/server.rs:141`) before the client answers the challenge, and three things in it grew without bound or went
inconsistent (from the source; measured with T8's tests against upstream's behaviour,
`Game-Data/Converted/handoff/net0/d19/netcode_cache_upstream.txt`):
- The same request sent from another source address (another link) replaced the client id's entry but kept the earlier
  link's entity mapping (`:178`): one request replayed from 300 addresses left 300 mappings. The connect-token replay
  table does not stop it (`TokenEntries::find_or_insert` accepts a token it has seen; its address check is a comment).
  A later response from an earlier link then connected that link under the entry that names the newer one.
- A link whose request named another client id updated its entry in place but left it under the old client id, so
  that connection could not complete.
- A pending connection never expired: the timeout check skips connections that are not connected (`:851`), and
  `ConnectionCache::remove` (`:180`) refuses them.
- `Server::send_netcode_packets` (`:901`) drained a link's queue of netcode packets (challenges, denials) and kept the
  empty queue: one entry per link that was ever sent one.

**What.**
- `add` keeps one entry per link and per client id: the same link repeating its request for the same client id
  refreshes the entry as upstream did; any other request first forgets the link's earlier pending connection and the
  client id's (`ConnectionCache::remove_pending`, new). Requests for a connected link or client id are refused before
  `add`, as upstream refuses them, so a connected entry is never touched.
- `check_for_timeouts` forgets a pending connection `timeout` seconds (the token's) after the last request for it, and
  drops the link's netcode send queue with it and with a connected client that times out.
- `send_netcode_packets` removes the queue it sends.
- `Server::state_sizes` and `NetcodeServer::state_sizes` (new) report the entries (`ServerStateSizes`: connections,
  link entities, replay windows, send queues).
- Three new unit tests (`src/server.rs`): one request replayed from 300 links keeps one pending connection, and no
  queue is left once the challenges are sent; a link naming another client id replaces its pending connection; a
  pending connection expires after its timeout counted from the last request, and a token without a timeout keeps
  one. All three fail with upstream's `add`, timeout check and send queue.

What T8 does not change: the connect-token replay table (a token is accepted again from another address while it is
valid; with T8 that moves the pending connection to the newer link, it no longer leaves one behind); netcode's
challenge goes to whatever source address a request names (no amplification: a 1 078-byte request draws a smaller
challenge). Both belong to phase 1's join, which issues the tokens.

## T9 — a client can read a connect token's public fields (`lightyear_netcode`)

**Why.** Phase 1's join hands the client a connect token from a server it may not trust. The netcode client sends its
connection requests to the token's public server addresses for as long as the token is valid, and a token without a
timeout keeps a dead connection forever; upstream's `ConnectToken` (`src/token.rs`) exposes none of these fields, so a
client cannot check them before it uses the token.

**What.** Four read-only accessors after `expire_timestamp` (`src/token.rs:322`): `server_addresses()` (the public
addresses as a `Vec<SocketAddr>`), `protocol_id()`, `create_timestamp()`, `timeout_seconds()`. Nothing else changes.
`ssx_net::connect_token` uses them (`Docs/architecture/net-protocol.md` §3.4).

## T10 — tick deltas from a peer convert without a panic (`lightyear_core`, vendored for it)

**Why.** `TickDelta::to_duration` (`src/time.rs:313`) was `tick_duration.mul_f32(self.value.to_num())`, which panics
for a negative or a too-large product ("cannot convert float seconds to Duration"). Tick deltas come from peers: a
client's pong carrying a tick 2^31 away made `lightyear_sync`'s `process_pong` compute a negative delta and **any
server panicked** (exit 101); a server's `SenderMetadata` with an interval of 2^31 ticks panicked the client's
interpolation timeline the same way (both confirmed against upstream by the hostile cases `PongOverflow` and
`MetadataOverflowFromServer`, `crates/ssx-net/src/harness/`). `TickDelta::to_i32` (`:357`) was
`self.value.round().to_num()`, which overflows in debug builds for values within half a tick of the type's limit.

**What.** `to_duration` returns `Duration::ZERO` for a delta ≤ 0 (a negative delta has no `Duration`), `Duration::MAX`
when the product would exceed half of it, and upstream's `mul_f32` otherwise (the same value for every delta upstream
accepted). `to_i32` rounds with `saturating_round`. A new unit test (`conversions_of_any_delta_never_panic`): a delta of
2^31 ticks (which wraps negative), a negative one, a normal one (equal to upstream's), the type's maximum against
`Duration::MAX`, and `to_i32` at both limits and at halves.

## T11 — oversized datagrams on Windows do not stall the UDP read (`lightyear_udp`)

**Why.** The endpoint reads at most 1 472 bytes per datagram. Linux cuts a larger datagram and returns the rest; Windows
reports it as the error `WSAEMSGSIZE` (10040) after discarding it, and upstream's receive loops (`src/lib.rs:225`,
`src/endpoint.rs:315`) treated every error but `WouldBlock` as the end of the frame's reading: one oversized datagram
per frame from anyone delayed every other packet by a frame (from the source; not measured: no Windows run).

**What.** Both receive loops recycle the buffer and read the next datagram on `WSAEMSGSIZE` when built for Windows
(`cfg!(windows)`), as Linux behaves; the constant is defined beside them. The arm is compiled but never taken on Linux.

## T12 — a peer's replication data does not panic replicon and is reported (`bevy_replicon`, vendored for it)

**Why.** Three places of the client's replication receive (`src/client.rs`: `apply_removals` :628, `apply_changes`
:707 and :715, `apply_mutations` :951) took a size from the server's message and called `Bytes::split_to` with it,
which panics beyond the message's end, and looked up a component-function id from the message with
`ReplicationRegistry::get` (`src/shared/replication/registry.rs:163`), which panics on an unknown id: **a hostile
server crashed every client** with one message (confirmed against upstream by the hostile cases
`ReplicationOversizeFromServer` and `ReplicationUnknownFnsFromServer`). Every other refusal of the client
(`apply_replication`'s errors, :281…:365) and the server's refusal of a client's mutation acks that do not read
(`receive_acks`, `src/server.rs:407`, which also kept reading the rest) were only logged at debug level: the
application could not end the connection of a peer that sends what no correct peer sends.

**What.**
- `split_checked` (new, `src/client.rs`): the size checked against the remaining bytes before `split_to`, an error
  otherwise (as replicon's own `read_userdata` already did); used at the three sites.
- `ReplicationRegistry::try_get` (new): `None` for an unknown id; the three sites return an error instead of panicking.
- `ReplicationReceiveError { client: Option<Entity>, error: String }` (new Bevy message, `src/shared/receive_error.rs`,
  registered by the client and the server plugins): the client writes one (`client: None`) where it refused the
  server's data (four sites); `receive_acks` writes one with the client's entity and stops reading that message.
- `ssx-net` acts on it: the server kicks the client (`MalformedReplication`), a client leaves the server and says why
  (`Docs/architecture/network.md` §7).

## T13 — what a peer has not acknowledged is bounded (`lightyear_transport`)

**Why.** A reliable channel's sender kept every message until the peer acknowledged it
(`ReliableSendState::pending`, `src/channel/send_reliable.rs:46`), without a bound: a peer that keeps its connection
alive but never acknowledges made its sender hold every reliable message it was sent, for ever — the server's memory
grew with each control message and replicon update for such a client (found by phase 1's audit, `network.md` §11,
§12; reachable once phase 2 replicates). Past 65 536 held messages the wrapping `u16` message id would also have
replaced held messages in the map.

**What.**
- `ReliableLimits` (new Bevy resource beside `FragmentLimits`, `src/channel/fragments/receive.rs`; in the prelude):
  `max_unacked_messages` and `max_unacked_bytes` per reliable channel and connection; `TransportPlugin` initialises a
  default (4 096 messages, 4 MiB: below the 32 768 ids the wrapping id tells apart; a guess marker states it) and an
  application replaces it (`ssx-net`: 256 messages, 256 KiB; `crates/ssx-net/src/limits.rs`).
- `ReliableSendState` counts the bytes it holds (`pending_bytes`, kept by `buffer_send` and `receive_ack`; `held()`),
  `ChannelSend::reliable_held()` reads them.
- The transport's send (`TransportPlugin::buffer_send`, `src/plugin.rs`) does not buffer a reliable send that would
  exceed a limit: it stops that link's sends of the frame with `TransportError::UnacknowledgedLimit` and writes
  `TransportSendError { entity, error }` (new Bevy message, in the prelude), so the application learns which link.
- `ssx-net` acts on it: the server kicks the client (`Unacknowledged`), a client leaves the server and says why.
- Test `held_messages_and_bytes_follow_buffering_and_acks` (single and fragmented messages).

## T14 — what a server makes a client replicate is bounded (`bevy_replicon`)

**Why.** The client's replication receive spawned an entity for every new server entity a message named
(`apply_changes`, `src/client.rs`: the vacant entry's `world.spawn_empty()`; `WriteCtx::get_mapped`,
`src/shared/replication/registry/ctx.rs:91`, for an entity inside component data) and buffered every update and mutate
message it could not apply yet (`BufferedUpdates`, `BufferedMutations`), without a bound: a hostile server could make a
client spawn entities or hold messages without end (found by phase 1's audit, `network.md` §11).

**What.**
- `ReplicationLimits` (new Bevy resource, `src/shared/receive_error.rs`, initialised by the client plugin with a default
  of 65 536 entities and 4 096 buffered messages, a guess marker at the code): `max_entities`, `max_buffered_messages`;
  `ssx-net` sets 2 × its connection limit (128) and 600 (64 until round `net3`: the receive reads a frame's mutate
  messages into the buffer before it applies any, and the server sends an unacknowledged mutation again every tick, so
  a client whose frame stalls receives one a tick; `ssx-net/src/limits.rs`).
- `ServerEntityMap` gains a limit (`set_limit`, set from the resource at each receive; a `clear` keeps it), `at_limit`,
  and a refused flag: a new server entity beyond the limit is refused **before it is spawned** — `apply_changes`
  returns an error at the vacant entry, `get_mapped` returns `Entity::PLACEHOLDER` without mapping or reserving and sets
  the flag, which the caller turns into an error after that component's write (`apply_changes`, `apply_mutations`).
- An update or mutate message that would exceed `max_buffered_messages` is not buffered; it is reported.
- Every refusal goes through T12's `ReplicationReceiveError`, and the client leaves the server.
- Test `the_limit_counts_mapped_entities` (`src/shared/server_entity_map.rs`).

## T15 — the server tells a client's goodbye from its timeout (`lightyear_netcode`)

**Why.** The netcode server called its disconnect callback the same way for a client's disconnect packet
(`Server::process_packet`, `src/server.rs:583`), for a client that sent nothing within its timeout
(`check_for_timeouts`, `:858`) and for its own disconnect (`Server::disconnect`, `:1093`), and the server plugin gave
every one the same `Disconnected { reason: ByPeer(None) }` (`src/server_plugin.rs:399`): a server could not tell a
player who left from one whose connection failed (the dedicated server logged "the client left, or timed out"). The
client side tells them apart already (`src/client_plugin.rs:186`: `ByPeer` for the server's disconnect, `TransportError`
with the state's name for a timeout). Found by the window checks of multiplayer phase 2's pause menu (round `net2`).

**What.**
- `DisconnectCause` (new, `src/server.rs`; exported, a Bevy component): `ByClient`, `TimedOut`, `ByServer`; the
  disconnect callback (`Callback`, `ServerConfig::on_disconnect`) gets it as its third argument from the three callers.
- The server plugin puts the cause on the link entity beside its `Disconnected`, whose reason now says it as the client
  side does: `ByPeer(None)` for the client's disconnect (as before), `TransportError("ConnectionTimedOut")` for the
  timeout, `UserRequested(None)` for the server's own disconnect.
- `ssx-net` counts a rider's goodbye and timeout (`ServerStats::left`, `timed_out`; `crates/ssx-net/src/server/ends.rs`)
  and the dedicated server names them in its log and status.
- Test `the_disconnect_callback_tells_a_client_that_left_from_one_that_timed_out` (`src/server.rs`; a connected client's
  disconnect packet, its timeout, the server's disconnect), and `crates/ssx-net/tests/session.rs`
  (`the_server_tells_a_riders_goodbye_from_a_timeout`, over crossbeam).

## T16 — the UDP endpoint takes the application's socket (`lightyear_udp`)

**Why.** `UdpEndpointPlugin::link` (`src/endpoint.rs:131`) always made its socket with `std::net::UdpSocket::bind`, so an
application could set no option before the bind. A dedicated server on `::` needs `IPV6_V6ONLY` off to serve IPv6 and
IPv4 on one socket (multiplayer phase 4, round `net4a`, `Docs/architecture/net-protocol.md` §24): Windows' default is
on (IPv6 only), Linux's is the system's `net.ipv6.bindv6only` (usually off), and the option cannot be changed after
the bind.

**What.** `UdpEndpoint` gains a private `prebound: Option<std::net::UdpSocket>` (`None` by default) and `pub fn
use_socket(&mut self, socket)`; `link` takes that socket when there is one, else binds as before, then sets it
non-blocking and reads `LocalAddr` from it exactly as upstream. Nothing changes for an endpoint without a socket of
the application's. The dedicated server makes its game socket with `socket2` (`apps/avalanche-server/src/bind.rs`) and
hands it over before the start. Tests: the crate's own `link_takes_the_applications_socket` (`src/endpoint.rs`: the
socket taken, `LocalAddr` read from it) and `apps/avalanche-server/tests/server/ipv6.rs` (a join over `::1`, IPv4 peers
of an IPv6 socket); the crate's tests standalone: `Game-Data/Converted/handoff/net4a/runs/vendor_tests.txt`.

## T17 — rav1d builds its 10- and 12-bit contexts only with `bitdepth_16` (`rav1d`, vendored for it)

**Why.** The game builds rav1d 8-bit only (`bitdepth_8`; a mod movie is 8-bit) and, since 2026-11-07, with its
assembly (`asm`). That combination did not link: `Rav1dBitDepthDSPContext::get` (`src/internal.rs:186`) built the 10-
and 12-bit contexts (`Self::new::<BitDepth16>`) whatever the features, and their film grain names
`dav1d_{fgy_32x32xn,fguv_32x32xn_i4{20,22,44}}_16bpc_{ssse3,avx2,avx512icl}` and
`dav1d_generate_grain_{y,uv_4{20,22,44}}_16bpc_{ssse3,avx2}`, which `build.rs` assembles only with `bitdepth_16`
(rust-lld: those 20 symbols undefined in each program that links rav1d). Without `asm` it
linked, and a 10-bit stream reached rav1d's 16-bit Rust code (the game's own reader refuses such a stream first:
`ssx-content`'s AV1 check, "10-bit pictures (a movie is 8-bit)", and any sequence header but the track's).

**What.** The two statics and the `10` / `12` arms carry `#[cfg(feature = "bitdepth_16")]`. Without the feature `get`
answers `None` for them, which upstream's caller already handles (`rav1d_submit_frame`, `src/decode.rs:5019`: "Compiled
without support for {bpc}-bit decoding", `ENOPROTOOPT`); the other callers ask only for pictures that were decoded. With
`bitdepth_16` nothing changes. The game's binary holds no 16-bit code of rav1d's (`nm`: 1 596 `*_8bpc_avx2` kernels, 0
`_16bpc_`; the `bitdepth_16` build has 3 378).

## T18 — rav1d builds without warnings as a path dependency (`rav1d`)

**Why.** Cargo shows the warnings of a path dependency (a registry crate's are capped), so the vendored crate printed
upstream's own warnings in every build of the workspace, which is kept warning-free (`AGENTS.md`); rustc 1.99 with
`bitdepth_8` and `asm`: four unused 16-bit file lists in `build.rs`, a method and a struct nothing uses, three elided
lifetimes, and the derived equality of a function-pointer newtype (`unpredictable_function_pointer_comparisons`, once
per wrapped function). Each change keeps the behaviour; no lint is allowed.

**What.** `build.rs`: `x86_bpc16`, `x86_64_bpc16`, `arm_sve_bpc16`, `arm_bpc16` only with `bitdepth_16` (their one use
is so gated). `src/disjoint_mut.rs`: `Bounds::overlaps` only with `debug_assertions` or `test` (its users: `mod debug`
and the tests). `src/internal.rs`: `Rav1dFrameContextTaskThreadPendingTasks` removed (nothing constructed or named it).
`include/dav1d/picture.rs` (`with_offset`, `lf_offsets`) and `src/cdf.rs` (`cdf_write`): the elided lifetime written
`'_`. `src/wrap_fn_ptr.rs`: `Fn`'s `PartialEq` / `Eq` written out with `core::ptr::fn_addr_eq` (the same comparison
of addresses the derive made). Checked: `cargo build --release`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` (debug assertions on) and
the same for `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` of `ssx-movie`: no warning.

## T19 — the Nacon GC-100 0110 uses its verified Linux controller mapping (`gilrs`, vendored for it)

**Why.** The user's physical Nacon GC-100 (`3285:0607`, input/USB device version `0110`, xpad) has GUID
`03000000853200000706000010010000`. gilrs 0.11.2's bundled database has the same USB device with version `0112`
(`03000000853200000706000012010000`), but its UUID lookup is exact. The actual v0.3.1 game logs a missing mapping;
the fallback maps native `ABS_Z` / `ABS_RZ` to `Axis::LeftZ` / `Axis::RightZ`, not to the analog trigger buttons
the game reads. Three physical press/release cycles per trigger reached 0…255. Simultaneous headless Bevy apps on
that same physical pad, one default and one exact-GUID mapped: the default trigger-button peaks stayed 0/0 with
0/0 complete cycles; the mapped peaks reached 1/1 with 4/4 complete cycles, including both held together. Evidence:
`Game-Data/Converted/handoff/lt-rt-20261110/`, `Docs/research/controller-input.md`. These are trigger-input proofs;
they do not claim that every controller binding or post-fix ride has already passed a physical test.

**What.** The published `.crate` was extracted unmodified first; its SHA-256 matches the registry checksum in the
workspace lockfile: `902fb00d3f6398e635be22e5c837b303c501835cca7ac11a47bba138f7aafdd8` (37 published files).
`SDL_GameControllerDB/gamecontrollerdb.txt` adds one Linux row for the observed **0110** GUID, copying the
existing **0112** row's bindings and preserving that original row and every other mapping. The preceding T19
comment identifies the modification. `lefttrigger:a2` and `righttrigger:a5` select this xpad layout's native
`ABS_Z` and `ABS_RZ`. The ordinary build script includes that Linux mapping, and the ordinary database selects it:
no runtime-library implementation change, process environment mutation, re-execution shim, new threshold or
global interpretation of arbitrary controllers' Z axes. Windows' mappings and native backend are unchanged.
The game and asset viewer receive the same dependency fix; Standard and Classic action layouts remain intact.

`src/mapping/mod.rs` adds two Linux regression tests using the device's native-code ordering. One verifies all
23 mapped native elements (including LT/RT as analog buttons, the four face buttons, shoulders, menu/thumb
buttons, both sticks, and D-pad axes/buttons), absence of trigger signals in the Z-axis slots, and the mapped
hat mask. The other checks that the original 0112 entry is preserved, neighboring GUIDs are not matched, and a
Windows mapping cannot override the Linux row. The actual normal mapping parser/database are tested, not a copy.

**Upgrade.** Replace the published gilrs crate on upgrade and reapply this one-row database addition only if the
upstream mapping still lacks the exact GUID; keep its focused regression coverage. A database update that still
contains only the 0112 GUID is not equivalent to this fix.

## T20 — gilrs uses the primitive floating-point maximum (`gilrs`)

**Why.** As a path dependency, gilrs exposes upstream's warnings instead of Cargo capping them for a registry
crate. On rustc 1.99 its import of `std::f32` makes the two `f32::MAX` uses in `src/ff/mod.rs` resolve to the
deprecated module constant. Both warnings are in the unmodified published source and are unrelated to T19.

**What.** Remove only `f32` from that import, retaining `std::fmt`. The same two expressions now resolve to the
primitive `f32` associated constant, whose value is identical. No gain-clamping behaviour changes and no lint
is suppressed. Its T20 comment identifies the modification.

## Tests of the patched crates

gilrs (2026-11-10, `Game-Data/Converted/handoff/nacon-v032/vendor-tests.log`):
`cargo test --manifest-path vendor/gilrs-0.11.2/Cargo.toml --lib --locked` from `Engine/`, standalone target
`.build/nacon-gilrs-tests`: **13 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored**, warning-free after T20. The two T19 regressions are
included. A scratch copy with the original published database restored fails the new exact-GUID test at the
missing-row assertion; restoring the patched database passes. No live vendor source was reverted for that negative
proof. Physical Bevy trigger-input A/B evidence predates the patch and is described under T19; the root session
owns the final actual-game and complete-binding acceptance.

Each crate's own tests, run standalone with the features the workspace uses, each against the other patched crates
(`Game-Data/Converted/handoff/net0/d19/vendor_tests.txt`): `lightyear_transport` 76 + 1 (85 + 1 with `compression_lz4`;
T1's two new tests included), `lightyear_messages` 25 + 3, `lightyear_netcode` 32 + 9 (T8's three new tests included; 1
ignored upstream), `lightyear_udp` 5, `lightyear_replication` 61 + 3 + 6 (7 ignored upstream), `lightyear` 1 + 4 (3
ignored upstream): all pass. One upstream test depends on wall-clock time: `lightyear_messages`'
`host_client_drops_queued_messages_after_a_timeline_error` (`src/plugin.rs:816`) fails when more than one 10 ms tick
passes between its two `app.update()` calls (the local timeline advances, its message waits for a tick its test timeline
never reaches); unchanged by the patches, measured on a loaded machine at the same rate with and without them
(`d19/messages_flake.txt`), and left as published. The patches' behaviour against a running server and client is in
`crates/ssx-net/tests/hostile.rs` and `examples/net_hostile.rs`.

Phase 1 (round `net1`, all eight crates, each against the other seven; `Game-Data/Converted/handoff/net1/records/
vendor_tests.txt`, the script beside it in `tools/vendor_tests.sh`): `lightyear_core` 45 (T10's test included; 2
doc-tests ignored upstream), `lightyear_netcode` 32 + 9 (1 ignored upstream), `lightyear_udp` 5, `bevy_replicon` 149 +
63, `lightyear_transport` 76 + 1, `lightyear_messages` 25 + 3, `lightyear_replication` 61 + 3 + 6 (7 ignored upstream),
`lightyear` 1 + 4 (3 ignored upstream): all pass. The crashes T10 and T12 fix were each confirmed against the upstream
crates by a hostile case before the patch (`handoff/net1/records/hostile/upstream_core_replicon.txt`) and survive after
it (`patched_T10_T12.txt`).

Phase 2 (round `net2`, the same script and features, all eight crates each against the other seven;
`Game-Data/Converted/handoff/net2/records/checks/vendor_tests.txt`): `lightyear_core` 45 (2 doc-tests ignored upstream),
`lightyear_netcode` 32 + 9 (1 ignored upstream), `lightyear_udp` 5, `bevy_replicon` 150 + 63 (T14's test included),
`lightyear_transport` 77 + 1 (T13's test included), `lightyear_messages` 25 + 3, `lightyear_replication` 61 + 3 + 6 (7
ignored upstream), `lightyear` 1 + 4 (3 ignored upstream): all pass. The transport's first run did not compile its tests
(T13's test named `vec!` in the `no_std` crate; the upstream plugin tests, which run the send and receive systems
without `TransportPlugin`, lacked the new `ReliableLimits` resource): T13's test uses `alloc::vec!`, and each of those
tests initialises `ReliableLimits` beside T1's `FragmentLimits`, as `TransportPlugin` does; the rerun is the record's
last line. T13's and T14's behaviour against a running server and client is in `crates/ssx-net/tests/instance.rs`
(`a_connection_that_never_acknowledges_is_kicked`, `a_flood_of_players_stops_at_the_fragment_limit_or_the_entity_cap`).
T15 (after the round's commit, its window check): `lightyear_netcode` 33 + 9 (T15's test included; 1 ignored upstream)
and `lightyear` 1 + 4 (3 ignored upstream) again, each against the other patched crates
(`records/checks/vendor_tests_t15.txt`): all pass.

rav1d (2026-11-07, `Game-Data/Converted/handoff/orchestrator/md9/`): its own tests from its folder, `cargo +stable test
--locked --release --no-default-features --features bitdepth_8,asm` (`+stable`: the crate's `rust-toolchain.toml`
pins `nightly-2025-05-01`, which rustup would otherwise install): 6 + 2 doc-tests pass (the test build prints three
"unnecessary `unsafe` block" warnings of upstream's in `cfg(test)` code; the workspace's build has none). The patched
decoder's pictures are the unpatched one's to the byte: the 65 s 1080p M-D9 movie (6 065 280 000 bytes of YUV, 1 and 4
threads) and the template's movie hash the same without the assembly, with it on the published crate (`bitdepth_16`),
and with it on the patched one; the decoder's sandbox proof and its system-call list pass unchanged (`content.md`
§20.9, §20.13).
